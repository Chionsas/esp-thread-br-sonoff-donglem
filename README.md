# ESP-IDF OpenThread Border Router on Sonoff Dongle-M

Custom OpenThread Border Router firmware for the **Sonoff Dongle-M / Dongle Max**, built on Espressif’s `esp-thread-br` and adapted for the Dongle-M hardware.

The ESP32 inside the Dongle-M runs the OpenThread Border Router, while the onboard **EFR32MG24** continues to operate as the Thread Radio Co-Processor (RCP).

This project provides a practical, self-contained OTBR solution with:

- Ethernet and Wi-Fi networking
- Ethernet-first connection policy with Wi-Fi fallback
- OpenThread Border Router functionality
- Thread dataset management
- Thread topology view
- Persistent Thread network state
- Home Assistant integration
- Multiple Border Router support
- RGB status indication
- Reproducible GitHub Actions release builds

> **Community project**
>
> This is not official Sonoff or Espressif firmware.
>
> It has been tested on real Sonoff Dongle-M hardware and is actively developed, but it should still be used at your own risk.

## Overview

This firmware allows the ESP32 inside the Sonoff Dongle-M to operate as a full **OpenThread Border Router**.

The onboard EFR32MG24 remains in **Thread RCP mode** and communicates with the ESP32 over UART using Spinel.

The ESP32 handles:

- OpenThread Border Router services
- Ethernet and Wi-Fi uplink
- NAT64 / Thread infrastructure services
- Thread dataset management
- Web-based Thread configuration
- Thread topology information
- Home Assistant integration
- Network recovery and failover behaviour

The firmware is based on Espressif’s current `esp-thread-br` architecture rather than the older heavily modified proof-of-concept implementation.

---

## Prerequisites

Before flashing this firmware, the Dongle-M should first be configured using the stock Sonoff firmware so that the onboard EFR32MG24 is placed into **Thread RCP Mode**.

### Step 1 — Initial Sonoff setup

1. Power up the Dongle-M.
2. Join the temporary Wi-Fi access point created by the stock Sonoff firmware.
3. Set a password.
4. Reconnect to the secured access point.
5. Configure Wi-Fi credentials.
6. Find the Dongle-M IP address.
7. Open the Sonoff Web UI in a browser.

### Step 2 — Enable Thread RCP Mode

1. Log into the Sonoff Web UI.
2. Open:

   **EFR32MG24 → Operation Mode**

3. Select:

   **Thread RCP Mode**

This configures the onboard EFR32MG24 with the Thread RCP firmware expected by this project.

> The current release updates the **ESP32 host firmware only**.
>
> It does not automatically flash or replace the MG24 firmware.

# Flashing the firmware

There are two supported approaches.

## Method 1 — Pre-built firmware using Sonoff Dongle Flasher

This is the recommended method for most users.

### Steps

1. Download the latest merged firmware:

   **[sonoff-dongle-m-otbr-v2.0.0.bin](https://github.com/Scoobler/esp-thread-br-sonoff-donglem/releases/download/v2.0.0/sonoff-dongle-m-otbr-v2.0.0.bin)**

2. Plug the Dongle-M into your computer using USB.

3. Open the official Sonoff Dongle Flasher:

   https://dongle.sonoff.tech/sonoff-dongle-flasher/

4. Click **Connect** and select the Dongle-M serial port.

   Port selection may be requested more than once; this is normal.

5. Click **Select**.

6. Choose **Customize**.

7. Upload:

   ```text
   sonoff-dongle-m-otbr-v2.0.0.bin
   ```

8. Start the flash.

The Dongle-M will reboot automatically when flashing completes.

> The normal Sonoff Web UI firmware-update page will **not** accept this image.
>
> Use the Sonoff Dongle Flasher or `esptool`.

---

## Method 2 — Flash using esptool

The release image is a merged ESP32 image and should be written at address `0x0`.

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
py -m esptool --chip esp32 --port COM3 --baud 460800 `
  --before default_reset --after hard_reset `
  write_flash 0x0 sonoff-dongle-m-otbr-v2.0.0.bin
```

Replace `COM3` with the serial port used by your Dongle-M.

### Linux / macOS

```bash
python3 -m esptool --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 460800 \
  --before default_reset --after hard_reset \
  write_flash 0x0 sonoff-dongle-m-otbr-v2.0.0.bin
```

Replace `/dev/ttyUSB0` with the correct serial device.

# First boot and network behaviour

The firmware uses an Ethernet-first connection policy.

On boot, it attempts connectivity in this order:

1. **Ethernet**
   - Ethernet is preferred.
   - If a usable Ethernet connection is obtained, it is selected.

2. **Saved Wi-Fi**
   - If Ethernet is unavailable, saved Wi-Fi credentials are tried.

3. **Provisioning access point**
   - If no Wi-Fi credentials are stored, a provisioning SoftAP is started.

4. **Wi-Fi recovery**
   - Repeated failed Wi-Fi connection attempts eventually trigger a recovery SoftAP.
   - If no new credentials are entered, normal connection attempts resume.

This provides a predictable fallback path without requiring manual recovery after a failed network configuration.

---

## Ethernet / Wi-Fi switching

The current Espressif OpenThread Border Router integration does not safely support arbitrary live backbone rebinding.

To avoid unsafe interface switching, the firmware uses controlled reboots when the preferred infrastructure interface changes.

### Ethernet lost while Wi-Fi is available

The Dongle-M performs a controlled reboot so that normal startup can select Wi-Fi.

### Ethernet returns while running on Wi-Fi

Ethernet must remain stable for approximately 30 seconds before a controlled reboot returns the unit to Ethernet.

This avoids repeatedly switching interfaces during unstable network conditions.

# LED status

The onboard RGB LED is used to show the current operating state.

## Boot

A short self-test is shown:

```text
Red → Green → Blue
```

## Infrastructure connection

| State | LED |
| --- | --- |
| Ethernet connected | Blue |
| Wi-Fi connected | Orange |
| Provisioning / recovery AP | Purple |

## Thread state

| State | LED |
| --- | --- |
| Thread attached | Short green pulse approximately every 2 seconds |
| Thread detached / disabled | Short red pulse approximately every 2 seconds |

The detached indication is suppressed briefly after Thread startup to avoid showing a false failure while the network attaches.

---

# Web UI and Thread management

Once the Dongle-M has obtained an IP address, open that address in a browser.

The Espressif/OpenThread Web UI provides access to Thread configuration and diagnostics.

Depending on the current upstream implementation, this includes:

- Thread network creation
- Joining an existing Thread network
- Active Operational Dataset management
- Dataset backup / restore
- Network properties
- Thread topology
- Border Router information
- Thread diagnostics

The selected Thread dataset and network state persist across normal reboots.

---

# Home Assistant setup

The Dongle-M can be used as a standalone OpenThread Border Router with Home Assistant.

## 1. Add the OpenThread Border Router integration

In Home Assistant, add the **OpenThread Border Router** integration.

Use:

```text
http://<dongle-ip-address>
```

For example:

```text
http://192.168.1.50
```

The `http://` prefix is required.

## 2. Add the Thread integration

Add or open the **Thread** integration.

The Dongle-M should appear as an available Border Router.

Set the network as the preferred Thread network if appropriate.

## 3. Mobile credential sync

If required, use the Home Assistant Companion App to send the Thread credentials to your phone.

This allows compatible Matter-over-Thread devices to be commissioned onto the same Thread network.

---

# Multiple Border Routers

Thread supports multiple Border Routers on the same Thread network.

Multiple Dongle-M units can be used together provided they share the **same Active Operational Dataset**.

Simply using the same:

- Network Name
- Channel
- PAN ID

is not sufficient.

The full Active Dataset must match.

You can inspect the dataset from the ESP console using:

```text
ot dataset active -x
```

When two Dongle-M Border Routers use the same dataset and are within Thread radio range of the mesh, they should join the same Thread partition.

This provides additional infrastructure paths and Border Router redundancy.

---

# Hardware

The validated Dongle-M hardware uses:

- ESP32-D0WDQ2-V3 host
- 16 MB ESP32 flash
- EFR32MG24 Thread RCP
- IP101GA Ethernet PHY

# Building from source

The current validated build environment uses:

```text
ESP-IDF v5.5.4
```

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Scoobler/esp-thread-br-sonoff-donglem.git
cd esp-thread-br-sonoff-donglem
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then build the Dongle-M configuration:

```bash
cd examples/basic_thread_border_router

idf.py -B build-sonoff-dongle-m \
  -D SDKCONFIG=sdkconfig.sonoff_dongle_m \
  -D SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=sdkconfig.defaults.sonoff_dongle_m \
  build
```

---

## Generate a merged firmware image

From the repository root:

```bash
python3 tools/release/merge_dongle_m_image.py \
  examples/basic_thread_border_router/build-sonoff-dongle-m \
  --output artifacts/sonoff-dongle-m-otbr.bin
```

This creates:

```text
artifacts/sonoff-dongle-m-otbr.bin
artifacts/sonoff-dongle-m-otbr.bin.sha256
```

The merge script reads the generated ESP-IDF flash metadata and uses the correct:

- flash offsets
- DIO flash mode
- 40 MHz flash frequency
- 16 MB flash size

The generated ESP-IDF metadata remains the source of truth.

---

# Developer / manual flashing

Individual ESP32 images can also be flashed directly.

The currently validated layout is:

```text
0x1000   bootloader/bootloader.bin
0x8000   partition_table/partition-table.bin
0xf000   ota_data_initial.bin
0x20000  esp_ot_br.bin
0x620000 web_storage.bin
```

Example:

```powershell
py -m esptool --chip esp32 --port COM3 --baud 460800 `
  --before default_reset --after hard_reset `
  write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_size 16MB --flash_freq 40m `
  0x1000 build-sonoff-dongle-m\bootloader\bootloader.bin `
  0x8000 build-sonoff-dongle-m\partition_table\partition-table.bin `
  0xf000 build-sonoff-dongle-m\ota_data_initial.bin `
  0x20000 build-sonoff-dongle-m\esp_ot_br.bin `
  0x620000 build-sonoff-dongle-m\web_storage.bin
```

For source builds, always prefer the generated `flash_args` / `flasher_args.json` from that build rather than assuming these offsets remain unchanged forever.

---

# Automated GitHub builds

Release firmware is built automatically using GitHub Actions.

Normal branch builds produce CI artifacts such as:

```text
sonoff-dongle-m-otbr-ci.bin
sonoff-dongle-m-otbr-ci.bin.sha256
```

Tagged releases use the tag name in the output filename.

For example:

```text
v2.0.0
```

produces:

```text
sonoff-dongle-m-otbr-v2.0.0.bin
sonoff-dongle-m-otbr-v2.0.0.bin.sha256
```

The same files are attached automatically to the corresponding GitHub Release.

This means the downloadable release firmware is built directly by GitHub Actions from the tagged source.

---

# Recovery / returning to stock

The Dongle-M can be returned to the official Sonoff firmware using the Sonoff Dongle Flasher:

https://dongle.sonoff.tech/sonoff-dongle-flasher/

Follow the Sonoff recovery / flashing instructions for the device.

The merged image provided by this project is a raw ESP32 flash image and is **not** intended for use with the Sonoff Web UI firmware-update page.

---

# MG24 RCP

The currently supported RCP is the stock Sonoff EFR32MG24 OpenThread RCP.

The ESP32 host communicates with it using Spinel over UART.

A future improvement may be to provide a fully reproducible host + RCP release path so that both processors can be built and maintained from source as one project.

For now, the safe and validated approach is:

1. use the stock Sonoff firmware to place the MG24 into Thread RCP Mode;
2. flash the custom ESP32 OTBR firmware;
3. leave the MG24 RCP firmware unchanged.
